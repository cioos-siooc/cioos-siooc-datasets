## Tracking progress of datasets and manage their setup on CKAN and ERDDAP
Most CIOOS datasets will follow different paths from initial EOI (Expression of Interest) by Data Owner to finally becoming available to the public on CIOOS website. However, there are certain essential stages that they have to pass thorugh before they can be considered complete. 
Members of different organizations will also be working on these datasets which can make it easy to miss important steps.
This repository has been created to track the progress of datasets from submission to completion using issue and bug-tracking tools.
